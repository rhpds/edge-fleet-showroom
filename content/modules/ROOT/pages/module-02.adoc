= 2. Edge Manager Operations

== Edge Manager Architecture
Edge Manager consists of the highlighted components as shown in the following high-level architecture diagram:

. *Edge Manager Service* which consists of an API Server, worker processes (not shown), and a PostgreSQL database
utilized for storing inventory and runtime information such as current device target configuration and the reported actual configuration
. *User access* is achieved via two primary interfaces: Edge Manager Web UI (which we briefly examined earlier) and Edge Manager CLI (which
we will explore in a later module)
. *Edge Device access* utilizes an Agent that is running on each managed device. The agent always 'calls home' to the Edge Manager service, 
so the device can be on a private network or have a dynamic IP address  
. *Git repository* integration (optional) enables storing of device and device fleet configuration. When utilized the Edge Manager service 
can periodically poll for updates
. *External systems* can be utilized by the Edge Manager service to authenticate and authorized users, get mTLS certificates signed, or query
configuration for managed devices

== New Store Edge Device Onboarding
Now that you have seen an overview of Edge Manager and examined its Architecture, let's bring our new store edge device online.
