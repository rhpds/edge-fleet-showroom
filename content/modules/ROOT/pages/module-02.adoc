= 2. Edge Manager Operations

[#highlevelarchitecture]
== Edge Manager Architecture
Edge Manager consists of the highlighted components as shown in the following high-level architecture diagram:

image::m2-architecture.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. *Edge Manager Service* which consists of an API Server, worker processes (not shown), and a PostgreSQL database
utilized for storing inventory and runtime information such as current device target configuration and the reported actual configuration
. *User access* is achieved via two primary interfaces: Edge Manager Web UI (which we briefly examined earlier) and Edge Manager CLI (which
we will explore in a later module)
. *Edge Device access* utilizes an Agent that is running on each managed device. The agent always 'calls home' to the Edge Manager service, 
so the device can be on a private network or have a dynamic IP address (this includes devices that are behind Network Address Translation (NAT), firewalls and cellular / WLAN uplinks) 
. *Git repository integration* (optional) enables storing of device and device fleet configuration. When utilized, the Edge Manager service 
periodically polls Git for updates
. *External systems* can be utilized by the Edge Manager service to authenticate and authorize users, get mTLS certificates signed, or query
configuration for managed devices

[#onboarding]
== New Store Edge Device Onboarding

image::m2-qr-web-5.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Device Details
Now that the device approval is complete, let's jump back into the Edge Manager Lab UI and further examine your new store device.

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Devices*
. Change the *Devices* section search filter from *Labels and fleets* to *Name and alias* (You may need to scroll down to the *Devices* section if there is a list of *Devices pending approval* present at the top of this window)
. Enter the *hometown name you chose* for your device (case sensitive) [underline]#in the search box# to filter the device list
. Click *YourHomeTown-store-{user}* device

image::m2-userdevice-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In the Device details tab we observe a few important details

. *System image (running)*: the device is running a bootc OS image that ends in *'...base:1.0.0'* (as its name implies, this is a 'base' image containing no custom applications)
. *Device status: Online* - the device is in an *Online* status (by default, the Edge Manager agent reports in to the Edge Manager service every 60 seconds which populates information like this)
. *Fleet name: None* - when we enrolled the device, we purposely did not join it to a Fleet (we will do so in a moment)
. Click *Terminal*

image::m2-userdevice-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: It can take a few moments for your Terminal session to establish (thank you for your patience)

Let's check a few items on our Edge Device via the Terminal

NOTE: You can copy the contents of these commands to your clipboard (if desired) by clicking the clipboard icon

. Examine the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version that is running on this device
+
[source,sh,role=execute]

----
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
----

In order for this 'back of store' device to function properly, it needs to have a point-of-sale application present.  Our front
of store point-of-sale Kiosk's access this application via an OpenShift route.  Let's examine that route next.

. Expand and select *local-cluster*
. Expand *Networking*
. Select *Routes*
. Click the 'pos' route *Location hyperlink* to open this route-to-app in a new browser tab

image::m2-routes-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Note that we receive an, *"Application is not available"* error message (this is expected at this time because we are running a 'base' device image which does not contain
any custom applications).  

image::m2-appnotavailable-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[#fleetmanagement]
== Fleet Management

In this section we are going to join our new store device to the existing fleet that you examined earlier, "*point-of-sale-prod*".  During this process, you will experience
how Edge Manager maintains desired state configuration for any devices that are a member of this fleet.

Keep the Application Browser Tab open and return to the *Routes* Browser Tab 

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Devices*
. Change search filter from *Labels and fleets* to *Name and alias*
. Enter the *hometown name you chose* for your device to filter the device list
. Click *YourHomeTown-store-{user}*

image::m2-userdevice-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

*Pop Quiz:* Do you remember the mechanism that we utilize to set fleet membership?

If you answered, "Fleet Device selector label", congratulations!  (This will be noted on your end of year, Edge Megastore, Inc., performance review)

The *'point-of-sale-prod'* fleet is configured with a *device selector* label set to: *pos=prod*.  Let's add that label to our new store device now.

. Click *Add label* and replace 'key=value' with *pos=prod* followed by pressing your *enter* key 
. Select the *(!)* icon at the end of the *'...base:1.0.0'* image

image::m2-userdevice-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Note that we have a *System image mismatch*.  Edge Manager is informing us that the desired state image for any device that is a member of this fleet
*must be* a bootc image ending in *'...pos-prod:1.0.0'*.  Since our new device is running a different (base) image, Edge Manager is automatically self-healing
the device to desired state.  

During this self-healing process, you will observe (via the *System status* pane):

. *'Update status'* change to '*Updating*', followed by
. *'Device status'* change to '*Rebooting*'

image::m2-userdevice-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: It takes a few minutes for the device to apply the new '...pos-prod:1.0.0' image and reboot. Now would be a good time to relax a little while you wait.  
Thank you for your patience!

. Wait for the device to report *'Online'* and *'Up-to-date'* in the *System status* panel
. Once item 1 is complete, observe how Edge Manager is now reporting the new '...*pos-prod:1.0.0*' System image in the *Configurations* panel
. Click *Terminal*

image::m2-userdevice-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Now that the image has been brought to the fleet desired state OS configuration, let's examine a few items within the Terminal

. Observe that the current booted image has been set to *'...pos-prod:1.0.0'* and our previous *'...base:1.0.0'* image is indicated as a rollback option

NOTE: The '*pos-v1-prod:1.0.0*' container listed is our point of sale application (which is accessed via the front of store pos kiosk's).

Return to your Application browser tab (if you inadvertently closed this tab, you can get back to this view by selecting *local-cluster* in the top menu, followed by
selecting *Networking\Routes* via the left-hand nav)

. Refresh your browser and note that the point of sale application is now available!

[#module2summary]
== Module 2 Summary
*Thank you* for completing our Module 2 Lesson.  

In this Lesson, you learned how to onboard a new store edge device into Edge Manager. You started your device with a simple base image (containing no applications) and then witnessed
how Edge Manager automatically swapped this image to one containing the POS App (after joining a Fleet that has this desired state configuration). </br>

You may be wondering:  "Why not just 
join the Fleet as part of onboarding?" and the answer is that you certainly could have done that but then you may not have learned as much about how Edge Manager operates.  Additionally, you 
may have wondered, "Why not just bake the app(s) into the 'base' image?" and that is also certainly an option. 

NOTE: Edge Manager gives users the optionality to configure things as they see fit, in alignment with any of their current build standards.

Regardless of the approach taken, it should hopefully be more evident to you that Edge Manager can play a significant role in helping to prevent configuration drift for edge devices.  

=== Up Next

You are well on your way to opening your new store for business; however, there is one small challenge. You may have noticed that our POS app is not the most useful (it doesn't actually _do anything_
other than present a static user interface with no user interoperability).  

In our final module, you will learn how to create a new fleet from scratch and specify a new point of sale *application* as part
of the fleet device template.  You will also explore the Edge Manager command line interface along with how to further monitor and decommission devices.
