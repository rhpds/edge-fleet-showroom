= 1. Edge Manager Introduction

== Welcome to Edge MegaStore, Inc. (Fictional Company)

Congratulations on your new job at Edge MegaStore, Inc. (EMI)! The pay isn't great
but if you love to learn about new edge management technology you are in the
right place. EMI is proud to provide our Customers with the
finest Edge Equipment available including a snack bar area with refreshments
(the Red-Sprinkled Donuts are a speciality).

It looks like our Marketing Department has some work to do with improving AI 
generated images ('Dionuts' and Flying Strawberries?!) but thankfully you don't
have to worry about that.  

Let's dive into your new role.

[#currentstorefootprint]
=== Current Retail Store Footprint

We have four existing EMI stores spread between the East and West Coasts of the United States.

In each location we have a back of store edge device running a RHEL 9 bootc image
container (which also includes the mandatory Edge Manager Agent). These store devices run a 
Point-of-Sale (POS) application which is accessible via the front of store point of sale kiosks.

=== Lab Login

In a moment, we are going to need your help bringing a new store online in your 
home town but first let's get you logged into your new work environment for an 
initial look around.

=== Exploring Edge Manager

You are now logged into an OpenShift Container Platform environment which also has an Advanced Cluster Management operator installed.  
If you have never used these capabilities before, don't worry.  We are here to examine the Edge Manager portions only.  Edge Manager is running 
on OpenShift as a set of containerized microservices (one of which displays the UI elements that we are going to explore now)

. Expand and set to *All Cluster*
. Expand the *Home* menu
. Select *Overview*
. Click *Edge*

image::m1-edgeoverview.png[link=self, window=blank]

Note that we see top level monitoring information for devices currently under management.  We also observe the current quantity of devices under
management.  Speaking of devices, let's examine them next.

. Expand the *Edge Management* left-hand navigation menu
. Click *Devices*

image::m1-devices.png[link=self, window=blank]

Here we observe the 4 _existing_ EMI East/West coast store devices that we discussed earlier.  They are reporting a green '*Online*' device status.  
In addition, they are all showing that they are members of an Edge Manager fleet named, '*point-of-sale-prod*'.  Let's explore this fleet next.

. Click *point-of-sale-prod*

image::m1-point-of-sale-prod.png[link=self, window=blank]

Note that we observe top level information for this specific fleet.  Let's edit the fleet to examine what has been configured.

. Expand the *Actions* menu
. Click *Edit Fleet*

image::m1-editfleet.png[link=self, window=blank]

. We see the friendly name that has been chosen for this fleet: *point-of-sale-prod*
. A *device selector* label has been configured: '*pos=prod*' This is a user generated key-pair value of their choosing. Any devices that matches this label 
will automatically be made a member of this fleet
. Note that we have *4 devices matching* this label (these are our existing store edge devices)
. Click *Next*

image::m1-editfleet-2.png[link=self, window=blank]

We are now looking at what we refer to as the fleet *device template*.  The device template contains the configuration items that we want to specify declaratively
(with Edge Manager responsible for enforcing these specifications, including healing a given device back to desired state, if any of these items drift).

. Here we see the bootc image that *must be running on a device* in this fleet, ending in '...*pos-prod:v1*'
. Click *+ Add configuration*

image::m1-editfleet-3.png[link=self, window=blank]

As part of the device template, We can specify additional host configuration items (like custom systemd service config, network config, etc.)

. Expand *Select a source type* (Edge manager can load pre-staged (inline) configuration files on the device, configuration files stored in Git or configuration files
stored on an internal web (http) repository)
. Click the '*-*' symbol to close the configuration item

image::m1-editfleet-4.png[link=self, window=blank]

Let's examine another element of the device template

. Click *+ Add Application*

As shown, we can also tie in one or more containerized applications which must be running on devices in the fleet.

image::m1-editfleet-5.png[link=self, window=blank]

Continuing our exploration, let's move on to one final item

. Select the '*-*' symbol to close *Application 1*
. Click *Next*

image::m1-editfleet-6.png[link=self, window=blank]

When applying updates to Devices, we have the ability to specify *Advanced configuration* options

. Uncheck the box next to *Use basic configurations*
. Click the *(?)* tooltip to learn about setting *rollout policies*
. Click the *(?)* tooltip to learn about utilizing a *disruption budget*
. Click *Cancel* to exit out of the Fleet edit

[#module1summary]
== Module 1 Summary
*Thank you* for completing our Module 1 Lesson.  

In this Lesson, you learned how Edge Manager surfaces top level edge device monitoring information.  In addition, you learned how Edge Manager
Fleet specifications can be set for all devices that are members of a given fleet.  This functionality allows users to declaritively specify their desired state for Edge Devices and subsequently rely
on Edge Manager to enforce these specifications in order to help eliminate configuration drift.

=== Up Next

In the next Module we will review the Edge Manager Architecture at a high level and then ask you to onboard your own (new store) edge device.
