== New Fleet Creation

We're in the home stretch and our new store is almost ready to open (thanks to you). 

In a moment we will have you create a new Fleet and wire in a new (and _functional_) point of sale application into the fleet device template. Before 
doing so, let's examine our networking route that will be utilized to access this *new POS app*.

. Expand and select *local-cluster*
. Expand *Networking*
. Select *Routes*
. Click the 'new-pos' route *Location hyperlink* to open this route-to-app in a new browser tab

NOTE: The 'application is not available' error message is expected at this time since we have not added the new POS app to our device yet

image::m3-routes-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Keep the Application Browser Tab open and return to the *Routes* Browser Tab 

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Fleets*
. Click *Create fleet*

image::m3-createfleet.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Populate the *Create fleet* wizard with the following *General info* values +

. *Name:*
+ 
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{user}-new-store-fleet
----
. *Device selector:*
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
fleet={user}
----
. Click *Next*

IMPORTANT: The following screenshots are shown for example purposes only and may not match your User ID. 
Unless you have been assigned, 'user1', do not use 'user1' vs. your assigned User ID: {user}. 

image::m3-fleetgeneralinfo.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Populate the following *Device template* values +

. *System image:* (Note: this is the same '...pos-prod:1.0.0' image that we used previously)
+ 
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/student-services/rhel9-bootc-edgemanager-pos-prod:1.0.0
----
. Click *+ Add application*
. *Image:*

----
quay.io/kenosborn/podman-compose:v2
----
. *Application name:*
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
new-pos-app
----
. Click *Next*

image::m3-fleetdevicetemplate.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Leave the *Updates* parameters at their default settings

. Click *Next*

image::m3-fleetupdates.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

*Review and create*

. Review settings and click *Create fleet*

image::m3-fleetreviewcreate.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Now that the we have created our new fleet, let's go to your recently onboarded device (from Module 2) and change its fleet membership

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Devices*
. Change the *Devices* section search filter from *Labels and fleets* to *Name and alias* (You may need to scroll down to the *Devices* section if there is a list of *Devices pending approval* present at the top of this window)
. Enter the *hometown name you chose* for your device to filter the device list
. Click *YourHomeTown-store-{user}* device

image::m3-userdevice-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click the *X* next to *pos=prod* to remove the current label

image::m3-userdevice-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click *Add label*
. Replace *key=value* with *fleet={user}* and press *enter*
. Observe that we are still _running the same_ *System image* ('...pos-prod:1.0.0') (a device reboot will not be required since an image swap is not needed)
. Observe that your device *Applications* pane is now populated with our containerized application

image::m3-userdevice-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: It can take a few moments for your newly added Application to report a green *Running* status. Thank you for your patience.

After your *new-pos-app* is returning a green *Running* status

. Click *Terminal*
. Check the containers that are now running on the device:

You've done a great job at Edge Megastore, Inc.!

If you'd like to call it a day, you are welcome to end the lab here (*thank you)*; however, if you would like to earn some Overtime (mythical) pay and explore a few more *advanced* topics 
you are welcome to continue.

[#cli]
== Edge Manager Command Line Interface

The Edge Manager CLI contains a robust set of commands. In fact, most (if not all) of what we have explored in this lab via the Edge Manager UI can 
be done via CLI.

NOTE: The Edge Manager CLI is currently still named after the upstream project: *flightctl* and has been pre-loaded for you in our lab environment 

. Click the OpenShift *>_* (Terminal) icon in the upper-right hand corner
. Set *Project* is set to: wksp-{user} (Note: You may need to scroll down to select)
. Click *Start*

NOTE: The wksp-user in this screenshot may not match your user ID  

image::m3-cli-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Give yourself some more screen real estate by clicking the *Open terminal in new tab* icon

image::m3-cli-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

We are now going to authenticate against the Edge Manager service and issue several CLI commands

The Edge Manager API is similar to a Kubernetes API in that we can utilize yaml to create/update/remove Edge Manager devices and fleets by using
'flightctl apply file.yaml' commands. 

For our last CLI example, let's connect to a console session within your actual hometown-store-{user} device

. To initiate a console session, utilize the following command
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
flightctl console device/$mydeviceid

== Edge Manager Device Monitoring and Decommission

Let's explore the device monitoring that is available for our new store device

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Devices*
. Change the *Devices* section search filter from *Labels and fleets* to *Name and alias* (You may need to scroll down to the *Devices* section if there is a list of *Devices pending approval* present at the top of this window)
. Enter the *hometown name you chose* for your device to filter the device list
. Click *YourHomeTown-store-{user}* device

image::m3-userdevice-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

We have previously seen (in the *System status* pane) how Device status and Update status change depending on our device state (rebooting, online, updating, up-to-date, etc.)

. In the *System status* pane, click the *(?)* tooltips for each of the status items and review their contents

image::m3-monitoring-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Edge Manager also surfaces Application Status in the Device *Applications* pane.

. Click *Details* and note that Edge Manager is reporting *'(!) Error'* in both the *System status* and *Applications* pane

image::m3-monitoring-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: This information is also rolled up holistically for all devices at both the Fleet level and overall Edge Manager level

You'll also notice that Edge Manager is surfacing device *CPU*, *Disk* and *Memory* pressure status.  

NOTE: In Edge Manager, users can customize device resource monitors and define alerts when the utilization
crosses a defined threshold (for example, 'trigger a *warning alert* if the average disk utlization exceeds 75% for more than 30 minutes' and 'trigger a *critical alert* if disk utilization exceeds 90% for over 10 minutes with a sampling interval of 5 seconds.").  

=== Device Decommission

All things must come to an end. For our final lesson, we will bid farewell to our new store device by decommissioning it.

Stop your Edge Device Virtual Machine

. Expand and select *local-cluster*
. Expand *Virtualization*
. Select *VirtualMachines*
. Select *vertical ellipses* 
. Click *stop*

image::m3-decommission-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Return to your device within Edge Manager

. Expand and select *All Clusters*
. Expand *Edge Management*
. Select *Devices*
. Change the *Devices* section search filter from *Labels and fleets* to *Name and alias* (You may need to scroll down to the *Devices* section if there is a list of *Devices pending approval* present at the top of this window)
. Enter the *hometown name you chose* for your device to filter the device list
. Click *YourHomeTown-store-{user}* device

Decommission your device 

. Expand *Actions*
. Select *Decommission device*

image::m3-decommission-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click  *Decommission device*

image::m3-decommission-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Set the *Show only decommisioned devices* toggle to *on* ((You may need to scroll down to the *Devices* section if there is a list of *Devices pending approval* present at the top of this window)

image::m3-decommission-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Here we can observe the list of decommisioned devices (there is no need at this point in our Lab to further delete devices)

[#labsummary]
== Lab Summary

image::m3-summary.png[link=self, window=blank, width=75%]

On behalf of the entire Red Hat Edge Manager team, we would like to extend a hearty *THANK YOU* for taking the time to explore this lab today.

We hope your time at Edge Megastore, Inc. has been an enjoyable and informative one.

BTW, judging by that store front image it looks like our EMI Marketing Department has some more work to do... :)

Thank you, again - have a great day!
