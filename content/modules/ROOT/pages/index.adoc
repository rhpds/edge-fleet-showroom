= Lab Overview

In this lab, weâ€™ll explore *Red Hat Edge Manager* (Tech Preview), a solution
designed to deliver simple, scalable, and secure management of edge devices
and applications. With Edge Manager, you declare the desired operating system
version, host configuration, and set of applications to run on a single device
or an *entire fleet of devices*. The platform then automatically rolls out these 
configurations to each device, where a local agent applies the changes and reports
back on progress and health status.

NOTE: Edge Manager currently supports image-based Linux operating systems running https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel-image-mode/overview?source=sso[bootc,window=blank] 

NOTE: https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl["Flight Control",window=_blank] is the upstream project and is accessible for you to explore outside of this Lab.  Red Hat Edge Manager (RHEM) is the downstream offering, currently in https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Tech Preview,window=_blank] meaning that it may not be functionally complete and is subject to change prior to GA.
