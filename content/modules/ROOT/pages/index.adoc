= Lab Overview

In this lab, we’ll explore *Red Hat Edge Manager* (Tech Preview), a solution
designed to deliver simple, scalable, and secure management of edge devices
and applications. With Edge Manager, you declare the desired operating system
version, host configuration, and set of applications to run on a single device
or an *entire fleet of devices*. The platform then automatically rolls out these 
configurations to each device, where a local agent applies the changes and reports
back on progress and health status.

NOTE: Edge Manager currently supports image-based Linux operating systems running https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel-image-mode/overview?source=sso[bootc,window=blank] 

NOTE: https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl["Flight Control",window=_blank] is the upstream project and is accessible for you to explore outside of this Lab.  Red Hat Edge Manager (RHEM) is the downstream offering, currently in https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Tech Preview,window=_blank] meaning that it may not be functionally complete and is subject to change prior to GA. 

== Lab Layout

In this lab you will be utilizing the following Red Hat software components which have already been preinstalled for you

- Red Hat Edge Manager + Advanced Cluster Management with OpenShift 
- OpenShift-Virtualization Virtual Machines (acting as Student Store Edge Devices)
- (Your Lab Laptop Browser will function as the retail Point of Sale Terminal)

== Edge Device Images 

We have included a few 'Image Mode' (bootc) Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 images for you to utilize during the Lab

Like any Container image, these images can be stored in a container registry (in our lab, they are stored in the internal OpenShift
Registry)

. image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/student-services/*rhel9-bootc-edgemanager-base:1.0.0*
. image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/student-services/*rhel9-bootc-edgemanager-pos-prod:1.0.0*

NOTE: These images were pre-built for you so that you can focus on learning about Edge Manager vs. building images
